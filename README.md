Email Notification
Once an invoice is created, an email is automatically sent to the customer's email using the configured Mailtrap SMTP account.

Trigger Email
Emails are sent from this controller action:


Mail::to($invoice->customer_email)->send(new InvoiceGeneratedMail($invoice, $totalTaxamount));

The mail template includes:

Invoice number

List of items

Subtotal

Tax

Grand total
